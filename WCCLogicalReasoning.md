A watch, which loses time uniformly, was observed to be 5 minutes fast at 8.00 p.m. on Thursday. It was noticed to be 7 minutes slow at 8.00 a.m. on the subsequent Monday. When did the watch show the correct time ? Explanation needed.

a) 7 a.m. Saturday b) 7 a.m. on Friday

c) 10a.m. on Sunday d) 11 a.m. on Friday

Explanation:
From Thursday 8pm to 8am Monday, 84 hours had elapsed. However, 5 minutes fast(on Thursday) + 7 minutes slow(on Monday) = 12 minutes lost time. All of the answers have the exact time, so we have to loose 5 minute to make up for that time. Since, it takes 7 hours to loose 7 minutes, we have to multiply the loses to make it the exact time. So, 7*5 = 35 hours. Then, 8pm Thursday + 35 hours from then is 7am Saturday. The answer is "a".
